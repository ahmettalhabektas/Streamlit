## Introduction

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Predictor, an exciting project that combines AI, data visualization, and the legendary story of the RMS Titanic. Whether you're a history enthusiast, a data science enthusiast, or just looking for some fun, this project offers a unique experience.

## Features

- **Randomized Adventure:** Feeling adventurous? Use the "Randomizer" feature to get a random passenger profile and find out your fate on the Titanic.

- **AI Survival Prediction:** Fill out a form with your details, and the AI model predicts whether you would have survived the Titanic disaster.

- **Data Visualization:** Explore data visualizations that reveal insights into the Titanic dataset. Investigate how factors like passenger class, gender, and age affected survival rates.

## How it Works

The Titanic Survival Predictor uses an AI model based on the Random Forest classification algorithm to predict survival. It considers various passenger attributes, including age, gender, class, and more, to provide an estimate of survival chances.

## Getting Started


# Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmettalhabektas/Streamlit/tree/master/Titanic%20Streamlit 
```


# Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
# Open your web browser and access the app at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `titanic.csv`: The dataset containing Titanic passenger information.
- `best_ran_model.pkl`: The trained Random Forest AI model for survival prediction.
- `alive/` and `dead/`: Image directories for representing survival outcomes.
- `README.md`: This documentation.
